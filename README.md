- Create a webpage with a 16x16 grid of square divs.

- Create the divs using JavaScript. Don’t try making them by hand with copy and pasting in your HTML file!
- It’s best to put your grid squares inside another “container” div (which can go directly in your HTML).

- Set up a “hover” effect so that the grid divs change color when your mouse passes over them, leaving a (pixelated) trail through your grid like a pen would. <!-- cspell: disable-line -->

- Add a button to the top of the screen that will send the user a popup asking for the number of squares per side for the new grid. Once entered, the existing grid should be removed and a new grid should be generated in the same total space as before (e.g. 960px wide) so that you’ve got a new sketch pad

  - Set the limit for the user input to a maximum of 100
  - Set the limit for the user input to a maximum of 100

- (Optional): Instead of just changing the color of a square from black to white (for example), have each pass through with the mouse change it to a completely random RGB value. Then try having each pass just add another 10% of black to it so that only after 10 passes is the square completely black.
